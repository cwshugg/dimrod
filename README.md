# CODAC - Ceaselessly Obedient Domicile Assistive Computer

**CODAC** is a collection of programs and scripts that make up my home server.
Ceaselessly obedient and versatile, CODAC is comprised of:

1. An Nginx HTTP server hosting a web interface
2. A Jellyfin media streaming server
3. A number of python services responsible for:
    * Interacting with WiFi lights/plugs
    * Monitoring the network
    * ...and more to come!

## Future Plans

* Implement a weather service that uses [this API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api)
* Implement a grocery list management service 
* Implement a conversation service used to:
    * Talk with CODAC
    * Instruct CODAC to interact with other services to accomplish things
    * Generally make me feel like Tony Stark
* Create microphone+speaker modules that allow me to speak with CODAC around
  the house.
